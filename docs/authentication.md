# How authentication works

[← back to the README](../README.md)

**Members type their name; the printer owner types a password.** An invitation
link asks a member for a name and nothing else, and the browser it was opened
in stays signed in. Nothing in the running system depends on a mail server.

How each kind of account gets in:

- **Members: the device is the credential.** No username, no password. The
  invitation signs in one browser, and every further device needs a
  single-use link the printer owner hands over. See
  [Members sign in by device](#members-sign-in-by-device).
- **The printer owner: username and password.** This always works. At least
  10 characters, capped at 128, and refused outright if the password already
  appears in a known breach corpus.
- **The printer owner: passkey** (WebAuthn). Optional, stronger and faster.
  Offered through browser conditional UI, so it can sign the owner in from the
  username field with no click at all.

Members who registered with a password before it went away keep it, and it
still works. Everything below about passwords and passkeys applies to the
printer owner and to those accounts.

The passkey is an accelerator, not the way in. That is the correction this
model makes over the one before it: an emailed link was doing the job of a
password while being harder to use and impossible to use at all when mail was
down.

### Why ten characters, and why a breach check

Length is the control that does the work. Composition rules — a digit, a
symbol, a capital — mostly move people to `Password1!`, which is in every
corpus there is. So the rules here are: ten characters minimum, and
[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) says no.

The breach lookup is k-anonymity: five characters of a SHA-1 prefix go to
`api.pwnedpasswords.com`, and the password itself never leaves the machine. It
**fails closed** — if that service cannot be reached, setting a password fails
rather than quietly skipping the check. Only registration and reset set a
password, so an outage cannot lock out anybody who already has one.

`HIBP_DISABLED=true` turns it off, and exists for exactly one case: a
deployment with no outbound internet at all, where failing closed would mean
nobody could ever register.

### Getting people onto passkeys

The thing that decides whether people get there is not the technology, it is
whether anyone ever asks them twice. Registration offers a passkey once; the
first version let people tap "Skip for now" and then never mentioned it again,
which left them typing a password every time without having chosen that.

So there are three prompts, and two tests holding them in place:

- A banner for anyone with zero passkeys, dismissible **for the session only** —
  closing it means "not right now", not "never".
- A line in the account menu saying how you currently sign in, with a way to
  change it.
- Honest copy on the skip: "Not now — keep typing my password", rather than
  implying it is a postponement.

All three disappear the moment a passkey exists.

### Mail is optional — genuinely

**Nothing in the running system needs a mail server.** People sign in with a
password, and notifications are in-app, written by `notify()` and read by the
Activity panel. Mail is called in exactly three places, and every one of them
is delivering a *link*: sending an invitation, resending one, and sending a
password reset.

With `SMTP_URL` or `RESEND_API_KEY` set, those links are emailed. With neither,
the admin gets the link on screen to hand over directly, and the app boots
normally rather than refusing to start. Same token, same single use, same
expiry either way.

For a group that shares an office, handing a link over is arguably the safer
channel: a token in an inbox sits there indefinitely and can be forwarded,
where one passed over in person cannot. When mail *is* configured the raw
token is still withheld from the admin — it exists only inside the message —
because that property is worth keeping wherever it can be kept.

### Forgotten passwords

**"Forgotten password?"** sits against each member on the guest list. The admin
presses it; a single-use, thirty-minute token is minted, emailed if there is a
transport and shown to the admin to hand over if there is not.

The link opens a set-password form. It does **not** sign anyone in — that is
the whole difference from the sign-in link it replaces, which signed whoever
held it in *as* that person. Here they choose a password and then have to use
it, and setting it revokes every session the old password opened. Both halves
are audited: `password.reset_requested` names the admin, `password.reset_completed`
names the member.

There is no self-service "forgot password" form. With no `sendResetPassword`
configured, Better Auth's `/request-password-reset` refuses outright — resets
are admin-minted so the flow cannot depend on a mail server that may not exist.

One detail worth knowing, because it is a deliberate deviation: Better Auth
consumes the reset token *before* it hashes the new password, so a password
refused by the breach check would burn the link on its way out and send someone
back to the admin over a password they were about to correct. `setPassword`
puts the row back — with its original expiry — when the failure happened after
consumption. The link is spent when a password is actually set, which is what
"single use" was ever meant to mean.

### Bootstrapping the admin

The printer owner is the one account nobody invites, so `prisma/seed.ts` writes
the row directly. A row cannot sign in on its own, so when the admin has no
password the seed mints a set-password link and **prints it**:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs migrate
```

Open it within thirty minutes to choose a username and a password. Lost it?
Re-run the migrator and it prints a fresh one — but only while no password has
been set. Re-seeding never resets an existing one.

There is deliberately no `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. It would sit in `.env.docker`, in
`docker inspect`, in the shell history that wrote the file and in every backup
of the host, still valid months later. A link that expires in half an hour is a
smaller thing to leak.

### Invite-only, enforced in one place

A `User` row can only come into existence when a pending invite matches the
address. That decision lives in a single hook, `user.validateUserInfo` in
[`src/lib/auth.ts`](../src/lib/auth.ts):

```ts
async validateUserInfo({ user, source }) {
  if (source.action !== "create-user") return;
  const invited = Boolean(await pendingInviteFor(user.email));
  if (!invited || !isClaimingInvite(user.email))
    return { error: "invite_required", ... };
}
```

Two conditions. A pending invitation for the address is necessary, and for a
while it was treated as sufficient — which, because Better Auth's
`/sign-up/email` answers anybody, made the *address* the credential: whoever
knew an invited address could post it with their own password and be given the
account. So the request must also be the redemption of that invitation's link.
`acceptInvite` checks the token and runs the sign-up inside `claimingInvite`
(`src/lib/invites.ts`), an `AsyncLocalStorage` scope the gate reads back. It
cannot be set from a request body, and a request that arrives at the endpoint
by itself is refused exactly as an address with no invitation is — same status,
same words, so the endpoint cannot be used to ask who has been invited. The
audit trail tells the two apart (`reason: "no_link"` / `"no_invitation"`).

Better Auth calls it before provisioning an identity **by any method**, from
`internalAdapter.createUser`. Password sign-up goes through that path with
`{ method: "email-password" }` exactly as passkey enrolment does, so adding
passwords neither moved this rule nor added a second copy of it in a route
handler to drift out of sync. `verify:auth` asserts both halves directly:
registering an address with no pending invite is answered 403 and leaves no
row, and so is registering an invited address without its link.

### The invitation link

1. The admin submits an address at `/admin/invites`.
2. `createInvite` mints 32 bytes of CSPRNG output, stores **only its SHA-256
   digest**, and emails the raw token inside the link. The raw token is never
   returned to the admin either — it exists in the email and nowhere else.
3. The invitee opens `/invite/<token>`, sees who invited them, and types the
   **name** they want to go by. That is the whole form. A name somebody already
   has, ignoring case, is refused, with a pointer to the printer owner if the
   name is theirs on another device.
4. Submitting checks the token again and calls the server-only
   `registerMemberDevice` as the redemption of that invite. It creates the
   account through Better Auth's own `createUser`, so the invite gate and the
   stamping hook run exactly as they would for a sign-up, and it starts a
   device session. They land on the board.
5. `databaseHooks.user.create.after` burns every open invite for that address,
   so the link cannot mint a second account.

Invites expire after 7 days, can be withdrawn, and can be re-sent — re-sending
**rotates the token**, so a previously leaked email stops working.

#### Why registering does not send a second email

The invite token was delivered to that mailbox and nowhere else, so following
the link already proves control of it. Making someone read a *second* email to
finish registering adds a hop without adding assurance — and it would put a
mail server back on the critical path for getting in, which is precisely what
this model exists to remove.

So registration creates the session directly. There is no in-process link to
redeem and no `AsyncLocalStorage` machinery holding one; the previous version
had both, and they existed only to work around the absence of a password.

### Members sign in by device

A member has no password and no username. Their browser is signed in when they
accept the invitation, and stays signed in for **four hundred days**, the
longest a browser keeps a cookie. To sign in on another device, or after
clearing cookies, they need a **device link**:

1. The printer owner presses **Link a device** against them on the guest list.
   This asks for re-authentication, like a reset, because it is the ability
   to become that person.
2. `issueDeviceLinkUrl` mints a single-use, thirty-minute token. It is stored
   as a digest in Better Auth's `verification` table, with its own prefix so
   `/reset-password` cannot redeem it. Any earlier link for that member is
   revoked. The link is mailed when there is a transport and shown to the
   owner to hand over when there is not, just like invitations and resets.
3. `/device/<token>` says whose link it is and offers one button. Opening the
   page spends nothing, so a chat app unfurling the link cannot use it up.
   Pressing the button spends the token and calls the server-only
   `signInMemberDevice`. If the browser was signed in as somebody else, that
   session is signed out first.

Both endpoints live in `src/lib/device-sessions.ts` and are declared with
`createAuthEndpoint.serverOnly`, so they are not on the HTTP router: nothing
new is reachable under `/api/auth`, and they are not in the OpenAPI document.
They refuse any account that is not a client. A passwordless way into the
admin surface would bypass both the twenty-minute window and the sudo gate.
Better Auth's admin plugin still refuses a session for a suspended member,
and revoking access also revokes any device link still outstanding.

**The session.** The row is created with `expiresAt` four hundred days out
and the cookie with the same `Max-Age`. Better Auth only slides a session once
it is within `expiresIn` (twenty minutes) of expiring, so a device session
never slides: it lasts its four hundred days and then needs a new link.
Middleware's twenty-minute re-stamp would otherwise cut the cookie short on
the first page view. The `ppp.device` cookie, holding a SHA-256 digest of the
session token, tells middleware to leave the cookie alone. It is a digest
rather than a flag so that a marker a member left behind cannot spare a later
sign-in on the same browser, such as the printer owner's, from the
twenty-minute rule. The marker grants nothing: the `session` row is still the
authority, and revoking access or signing out ends it immediately.

**What this trades away.** A member's browser is now their only credential.
On a shared office machine, anyone who sits down at a member's browser is
that member until somebody signs out. That is the threat the twenty-minute
window was chosen for, and members no longer have it. Signing out asks for
confirmation, because getting back in takes a new link. The owner keeps the
short window, which guards the admin surface.

#### Usernames

The printer owner's, and those of members who registered with a password.
3–32 characters of letters, digits, `-` and `_`. Case is accepted but not kept:
the value is folded to lower case on write and looked up folded, so `Ayla_B` is
stored as `ayla_b`, signs in as either, and cannot be registered twice in
different clothes. `displayUsername` keeps whatever was typed.

Matching case-insensitively rather than refusing capitals is the friendlier
half of that: somebody whose phone capitalises the first letter should be told
the username is taken, not that it is malformed.

### Privileged fields cannot be set over the wire

`role`, `initials` and `invitedById` are declared `input: false`. Better Auth
does not quietly strip them — it **refuses the whole request** with
`FIELD_NOT_ALLOWED`, which is the better failure: a sign-up that half-worked
would be harder to notice than one that did not. They are written server-side
in `databaseHooks.user.create.before`, read out of the invite row.

Fields that are not declared at all — a chosen `id`, a posted `emailVerified` —
reach the endpoint and are simply overruled. There are tests for both halves.

### Exactly one admin

Application code refuses to seed a second admin, but application code is one
bug away from being wrong, so the storage layer enforces it too:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "user_single_admin" ON "user" (role) WHERE role = 'admin';
```

The index covers only admin rows, so it permits any number of clients and
exactly one admin.

### Authorisation

[`src/lib/authz.ts`](../src/lib/authz.ts) holds the handoff's core rule as one
exported fragment that every query composes:

```ts
export function storyScope(actor: Actor): Prisma.StoryWhereInput {
  return actor.role === "admin" ? {} : { uploaderId: actor.id };
}
```

`getStoryOr404` answers **404, not 403**, for a client asking after somebody
else's story — a 403 would confirm the story exists. `requireAdmin` does the
same for admin-only routes.

`src/middleware.ts` only checks that a session cookie is *present*, to redirect
early instead of flashing a shell. It is deliberately not the boundary: a
forged cookie gets past it and no further. The real checks run in every page
and every server action.

### Confirming it is still you

Four things an admin can do outlive any session: inviting somebody (a whole new
account), re-sending an invitation (a fresh working link), minting a
password-reset or device link (the ability to become that person) and revoking
or restoring access. All four ask for the passkey or the password again if the
current sign-in is more than five minutes old, and send you to `/reauth` if it
is.

This is the sudo gate, and it exists because shortening the session window does
not help against a cookie captured *now*. It is the one control a thief holding
a copied cookie cannot satisfy.

Withdrawing an unaccepted invitation is not gated — it only ever removes reach
— and nor are `/admin/benefits` and `/admin/catalog`, which decide what the
request form offers and grant nobody anything.

`/reauth` offers both the passkey and the password on purpose. Every account
has a password by construction and only some have a passkey, so requiring a
passkey would leave an admin without one unable to revoke access.

One thing worth knowing, because it explains a spare row in `session`: Better
Auth has no way to assert an identity without creating a session, so
re-authenticating signs you in again and the gate reads the age of the session
that comes back. The session it replaces is left to expire, which at twenty
minutes is not long.

### Other decisions worth knowing

- **Cookies** are `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `__Secure-` prefixed, and keyed
  on the *URL scheme* rather than `NODE_ENV` — a production boot over plain
  HTTP throws unless it is loopback, and an HTTPS deployment always gets the
  flag regardless of how the env is set.
- **The printer owner's session is worth twenty idle minutes**, sliding every
  minute (`SESSION_IDLE_SECONDS`); a member's device session is the exception
  described [above](#members-sign-in-by-device). It used to be thirty days with a daily slide, which
  in practice meant *forever*: `expiresIn` is an idle window that renews, so a
  session used once a month never expired at all. Twenty minutes is only
  humane because passkeys are here — which does make the passkey nudge
  load-bearing rather than decorative. The full reasoning, including why not a
  JWT and why the token stays in a cookie, is in
  [the security audit](security-audit.md#the-session-window).
- **Middleware re-stamps the session cookie on page navigations.** Better Auth
  slides the database row and the cookie together, but Next forbids writing a
  cookie during a React Server Component render, so browsing pages would keep
  the row alive while the browser's copy quietly expired. Harmless at thirty
  days; at twenty minutes it signs people out mid-task. The cookie is never the
  authority — the row is — so extending the browser's copy cannot extend a
  session, it only stops the cookie dying first.
- **Session cookie caching is off.** It would trust a signed snapshot without
  a database lookup, which makes sign-out lag by the cache lifetime. A DAST
  probe caught exactly that; see [the security audit](security-audit.md).
- **CSP carries a per-request nonce** minted in `src/middleware.ts`, so
  `script-src` needs no `'unsafe-inline'`. Every script tag on a rendered page
  carries it.
- **Rate limiting** is on, in Postgres, with the password paths capped well
  below the blanket rule: `/sign-in/username`, `/sign-up/email` and
  `/reset-password` get 10 a minute per IP. Ten rather than three *because an
  office sits behind one NAT address* — a tighter limit would lock out the
  colleague at the next desk. Ten a minute still puts online guessing several
  thousand years away from a ten-character password, which is the number that
  matters.
- **No user enumeration**: a wrong password and an invented username get
  byte-identical responses, and an unknown username still pays for a password
  hash so the wall clock does not answer either. Both are probed.
- `SameSite=Lax`, not `Strict`, because `Strict` would drop the cookie on the
  hop from a set-password link and the sign-in would appear to silently fail.
- **Reset tokens are hashed at rest.** `verification.storeIdentifier: "hashed"`
  means the table holds a digest, not a link anyone could paste into a URL.
  `prisma/reset-token.ts` reproduces that digest for the two places that mint a
  row directly — the admin control and the seed — and is the single definition
  of the format, because the migrator image ships `prisma/` and nothing else.
