# ppp deploy wizard — the single entry point for deploying Pretty Please Print.
#
# Runs ON THE NAS, in the directory holding docker-compose.prod.yml and
# .env.docker. That placement is the whole design: the NAS has no source tree,
# no git and no toolchain — it consumes images CI built, signed and scanned —
# so the wizard asks the registry what exists rather than asking a checkout.
#
# It answers the questions a bare `sed PPP_TAG && docker compose up -d` does
# not:
#   1. WHICH image?   → lists what is actually published to ghcr.io, newest
#      first, with publish dates and the live one marked, showing a release
#      version where one exists and the commit SHA otherwise. You pick from a
#      menu instead of copying a tag out of a CI log. A version that is a
#      GitHub release carries its title, so "which one was that?" is answered
#      in the menu.
#   2. IS IT PUBLISHED YET? → a version tag exists a few minutes before its
#      images do. A version is refused until every image exists at that tag,
#      instead of failing halfway through the pull.
#   3. WHAT DOES UPGRADING NEED? → shows the "Upgrading" notes of every
#      release between what is running and what was chosen, and asks. They
#      come from the GitHub release bodies because there is no checkout here
#      to read a changelog from. A SHA build is placed among the releases by
#      git ancestry (GitHub's compare API), not by date. When the wizard
#      cannot tell what lies in between it says so and still asks — it never
#      treats "could not find out" as "nothing to read".
#   4. IS IT INTACT?  → cosign-verifies the image against the identity of the
#      release-images workflow on this repo before anything is swapped. If
#      cosign is absent it says so loudly rather than quietly skipping.
#   5. DID IT WORK?   → polls the public health URL after the swap, and rolls
#      back to the previous tag automatically if it does not come good.
#
# 2 and 3 only read: one releases request, a handful of compare requests for a
# SHA, one `docker manifest inspect` per image. Deploying from one SHA build to
# a newer one with no release in between prints and asks exactly what it did
# before they existed.
#
# The images are public, so no registry credential is needed to pull one. A
# token is optional and buys only a longer menu: GitHub gates the package
# *listing* API even for public packages, so without one the wizard lists
# releases instead — which is the right list for most deployments anyway.
#
# When a token IS given (a fork with private packages, or someone following
# main by SHA) it is borrowed and returned: read from a hidden prompt, used for
# the pull, then `docker logout` on exit including on failure. Nothing
# long-lived is left behind.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy-wizard.sh              # interactive
#   ./deploy-wizard.sh -n 25        # widen the candidate window
#   ./deploy-wizard.sh --status     # read-only: what is live, and what is new
#
# Nothing is pulled or swapped without an explicit menu choice and a y/N.

# has no published release and asked. An old SHA is not caught: it is placed
# before the oldest release listed, so it is shown the notes of the hundred
# that are listed and not of the ones before them.

# Two things this filtering has to get right, both learned the hard way:
#   - release-images publishes cosign signatures and SBOM attestations to the
#     same package, tagged `sha256-<digest>.sig` / `.att`. Those are not
#     runnable images; only a 7-hex-char tag is one.
#   - sort by created_at, NOT updated_at. Re-pointing `latest` on a new
#     release touches the OLD version's updated_at too, so ordering by it
#     reshuffles history and shows a build's date as the day it was
#     superseded.
#
# Two JSON documents go in on stdin, the image list and the release list,
# separated by \x1e — a byte JSON cannot contain unescaped. Not an argument or
# an environment variable: a release list with its bodies passes the kernel's
# 128 KB limit on a single string, and the wizard would die with "Argument
# list too long" on the day the project had written enough release notes.
#

# ----- what does upgrading need? --------------------------------------------
# A release can need something done BEFORE its image starts: a snapshot, a
# one-shot migration container, a variable that changed meaning. That is
# written in the release notes under an "Upgrading" heading, and nobody reads
# release notes on a NAS. So show the Upgrading section of every release
# between what is running and what was chosen — every one, because going from
# v0.1.0 to v0.4.0 crosses the steps of v0.2.0 and v0.3.0 too — and ask.
#
# "Between" is decided by git ancestry, not by dates. Each end is given a base,
# the newest release it contains: a version is its own base; a SHA build is
# placed by asking GitHub's compare API whether it contains a release. The
# releases strictly after the lower base, up to and including the higher one,
# are the ones crossed. Going back crosses the same ones, and shows them too:
# they say what each release changed and whether there is a way back.
#
# The rule that matters most: "could not find out" is never "nothing to
# read". Every way of not knowing — no release list, a tag that is neither a
# version nor a SHA, a version GitHub has no release for, a compare call that
# fails, history that is not one line, notes that mention upgrading in a form
# the wizard cannot parse — says so, says the notes were NOT shown, and asks.
