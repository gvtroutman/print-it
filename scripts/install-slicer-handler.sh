# Register prusa-open.sh as the handler for `ppp://` links on this Linux
# desktop, and lay down a config skeleton for it to read.

# Run it once, on the machine that has the printer and PrusaSlicer:
#   ./scripts/install-slicer-handler.sh
#
# What it does, all under your own home directory — nothing system-wide, no
# sudo:
#   1. copies prusa-open.sh to ~/.local/bin/ppp-open, and writes a .desktop
#      entry into ~/.local/share/applications pointing at *that copy*;
#   2. makes it the default handler for the x-scheme-handler/ppp MIME type;
#   3. creates ~/.config/ppp/slicer.conf (mode 600) for you to fill in, if it
#      is not already there.
#
# macOS and Windows register a scheme differently (a .app/Info.plist and a
# registry key respectively) — docs/prusaslicer.md has both. This installer is
# Linux/XDG only, and says so rather than pretending to work elsewhere.
