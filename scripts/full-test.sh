# ppp full local test — everything CI gates on, run against this working copy.
#
# "Green CI is not enough" is this project's own rule: a change is merged after
# the whole stack has been raised from the working copy on a FRESH data
# directory and every suite has run against the built image. Doing that by hand
# is nine commands, three env files and a teardown, and each of them has been
# got wrong at least once. This script is that run, the same every time.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Refuses to start if it could hurt something that is already here: a ppp
#      stack of any kind (the container names are fixed, so there can only be
#      one), a port the stack needs, or env files a killed run left saved.
#   2. The static gates — typecheck, links, secrets, trivy, the upload
#      validator — BEFORE touching any env file, so the secret scanner sees
#      your real .env* and not a generated one.
#   3. Saves .env, .env.backup and .env.docker, writes a throwaway .env.docker
#      and raises the stack under its own project name on a data directory
#      outside the repository.
#   4. The nine integration suites in CI's order, all of them even after one
#      fails, then the two image pins CI keeps.
#   5. Takes the stack down, removes its data and puts the three env files
#      back exactly as they were — on success, on failure and on Ctrl-C.
#
# Two things it deliberately does not do:
#   - It never removes a stack it did not raise. The project is `ppp-fulltest`,
#     not `ppp`, so `down` cannot reach yours; and before the first suite it
#     checks that the app container answering on :3000 belongs to this run.
#     The suites wipe users and tickets.
#   - It does not itself interrupt a suite that is running. A signal sent to
#     this script alone (`kill <pid>`) is acted on once the current step has
#     returned. Ctrl-C in a terminal is different: it goes to the whole
#     foreground group, so the suite gets it too and usually ends at once.
#     Either way the cleanup then runs in full, and a second Ctrl-C during it
#     is ignored so the env files are always put back.
#
# It is CI's `verify` job in what matters — the same three compose files, the
# same profile, the same suites in the same order — and differs where a
# developer's machine has to be protected: the project is `ppp-fulltest`, the
# images are tagged `full-test-local`, DATA_ROOT is a throwaway directory, and
# the health wait is longer (120 s against CI's 90).
#
# What it leaves behind: the images it built, tagged `:full-test-local` (so a
# pulled `:latest` is never overwritten), and the logs.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/full-test.sh                 # everything; exit 0 only if all passed
#   scripts/full-test.sh --no-build      # raise the stack without rebuilding
#   scripts/full-test.sh --only "verify:auth verify:api"   # a subset of suites
#   scripts/full-test.sh --preflight     # only the refusals in step 1, then exit
#   scripts/full-test.sh --restore       # undo what a killed run left behind
#
# --no-build and --only are for iterating; both print PARTIAL RUN, and neither
# is a release gate.
#
# Environment:
#   PPP_FULLTEST_OUT             where logs and the data directory go
#                                (default: a fresh directory under $TMPDIR)
#   PPP_FULLTEST_HEALTH_TIMEOUT  seconds to wait for /api/health (default 120)
#   CHROME_PATH                  passed through to verify:passkey
