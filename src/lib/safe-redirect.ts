/**
 * Where a redirect target is allowed to point.
 *
 * Open redirects are how a phishing page borrows your domain's credibility,
 * and this app hands a `?next=` or a form's `from` straight to the browser
 * right after somebody picks their name or unlocks the owner pages — the
 * moments a person is most willing to believe whatever they land on.
 *
 * There used to be four copies of this rule, in the old sign-in and re-auth
 * pages and two server-action helpers, and all four were wrong the same way:
 *
 *     raw.startsWith("/") && !raw.startsWith("//")
 *
 * A backslash walks straight through that. `/\evil.example` starts with "/"
 * and does not start with "//", so it was returned verbatim — and the WHATWG
 * URL parser treats "\" as "/" in the relative-slash state, so the browser
 * resolves it to https://evil.example/. Two more variants (`/\/` and `/\\`)
 * do the same.
 *
 * The lesson is not "also reject backslashes". It is that prefix matching
 * cannot answer this question at all, because the question is *what will a URL
 * parser do with this string* — so the check asks one. Resolve the target
 * against an origin that cannot exist and keep it only if it stayed there.
 * Anything that escapes, by whatever spelling, has moved off-origin and is
 * refused.
 *
 * Pure on purpose — no `server-only` — so the probes can exercise it directly
 * rather than re-implementing it and drifting, which is the same reasoning
 * `src/lib/scope.ts` is separate from `src/lib/authz.ts`.
 */

 * An origin no deployment can ever be. Resolving against a real one would let
 * a target that happens to match the deployment's own host pass for the wrong
