/**
 * Everything that can happen to a ticket, in one place.
 *
 * This file exists because there are now two front doors onto the same
 * operations — the server-rendered forms in `src/app/actions/stories.ts` and
 * the JSON API under `src/app/api/stories` — and an authorisation rule that
 * lives in the caller is a rule that only holds for the caller that
 * remembered it. Everything below takes an `Actor` and decides for itself:
 * who may, from which state, what the uploader is told, and what goes in the
 * trail. A new front door gets all of that by construction.
 *
 * The four rules the admin actions have always had are unchanged, and are
 * enforced here rather than in the layer above:
 *
 *   1. Role is checked on every call. Not rendering a button is not
 *      authorisation, and neither is not documenting an endpoint.
 *   2. Transitions go through `assertTransition` — forwards, one step, and
 *      `Declined` only from `Requested`.
 *   3. The uploader is told. That is the whole point of the Activity panel.
 *   4. An audit row is written *after* the change commits, so the trail
 *      cannot claim something that did not happen.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here: `redirect`, `notFound`, and anything that
 * knows about a form or a status code. Failures leave as `StoryProblem`,
 * which carries an HTTP status the API can answer with and a sentence the
 * form can put in a toast. Translating one into the other is the caller's
 * job, because the right answer differs — see `src/lib/api.ts` for why the
 * API says 403 where a page says 404.

 * Change how much a print matters.
 *
 * The requester sets a priority when they file, and things change: the part
 * is suddenly holding up a build, or it turns out there is no rush after all.
 * Open to the two people it concerns — the requester on their own ticket, and
 * the printer owner on any, who may have a view about what goes on the bed
 * first. Somebody else's ticket is a 404 through the scope, like every read.
 *
 * Only while the ticket is still on the rail. Once it is `Done` or `Declined`
 * there is nothing left to order, and a priority edited afterwards would only
 * rewrite what the history says was asked for. (A feature request allows the
 * edit in any status; a closed request there is still a statement of what
 * someone wants. A printed part is finished.)
 *
 * It orders the owner's queue and promises nothing else: `high` is a request,
 * not a booking.
