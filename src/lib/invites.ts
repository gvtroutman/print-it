 * "This request is redeeming this invitation's link."
 *
 * The invite gate in src/lib/auth.ts used to ask one question — is there a
 * pending invitation for this e-mail address — and Better Auth's sign-up
 * endpoint is reachable by anyone. Put together, the *address* was the
 * credential: anybody who knew or guessed an invited address could post it to
 * `/api/auth/sign-up/email` with a password of their own and be handed the
 * account and a session, without ever seeing the link. The token in the link,
 * the thing that proves the mailbox, played no part.
 *
 * So the gate now asks a different question, and this is how it is answered.
 * The only code that may open an account is the code that has just checked a
 * token (`acceptInvite`), and it says so by running the sign-up inside
 * `claimingInvite`. The gate reads it back with `claimedInviteFor`, which also
 * checks that the address in the sign-up body is the one the invitation
 * decided on. A request that arrives at the endpoint by itself has no claim
 * around it, and is refused exactly as an address with no invitation is.
 *
 * The claim names the invitation by id rather than by address, because an
 * invitation need not have one.
 *
 * AsyncLocalStorage rather than a field in the sign-up body, because a body is
 * the one thing the caller controls: this cannot be set from outside the
 * process. It hangs off `globalThis` so that two copies of this module — which
 * a bundler is free to make — still share one store.
