 * holds only for the caller that remembered it. Both doors now hand over a
 * name and some bytes, and everything that decides whether those become a
 * ticket is below.
 *
 * Order matters. Nothing is written to storage until the bytes have been
 * inspected, and no story row exists until the file is in place — so a
 * rejected file leaves nothing behind, and a story never points at a file
 * that was not stored.
