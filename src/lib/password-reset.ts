 * the admin resetting a member's forgotten password, and the printer owner
 * establishing their own for the first time (`prisma/seed.ts`).
 *
 * The row it writes is Better Auth's, so redeeming it goes through Better
 * Auth's `/reset-password` endpoint with all of its checks — expiry, single
 * use, length, and the breach lookup. Nothing here re-implements any of that;
 * this only decides *when* a token exists.
 *
 * Note what the link does NOT do: it does not sign anybody in. Whoever holds
 * it can set a password and must then use it, which is the whole difference
 * between this and the sign-in link it replaces.
