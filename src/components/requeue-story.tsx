 * the first print is usually a test, so re-running a finished (or declined)
 * one should not mean hunting down the model file and re-uploading it.
 *
 * A link, not a form. It used to post straight to an action that cloned the
 * ticket as it was; it now goes to `/story/{id}/again`, the request form
 * filled in with the old wish, because the second print is rarely meant to be
 * identical to the first. Nothing is created until that form is sent, and the
 * original is left exactly as it was.
