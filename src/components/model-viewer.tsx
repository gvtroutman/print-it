/**
 * The real geometry, rotatable. Handoff §4.
 *
 * Replaces the stand-in primitive the prototype used — it could not parse a
 * mesh, so it drew a torus knot and hoped. This loads the actual uploaded
 * model — STL, 3MF, OBJ, PLY, AMF, GLB or glTF — from `src`, which is always
 * one of the app's own scoped routes (`/api/models/[id]` for an order's main
 * model, `/api/stories/[id]/attachments/[id]` for another part).
 *
 * Every model is drawn in the requested filament colour, whatever materials
 * the file carries: the point is to see what will come off the printer.
 *
 * three.js is ~600 KB, so it is imported dynamically inside the effect: it is
 * fetched when someone opens a ticket, and never on the board or the queue.
 *
 * The handoff's lighting rig is kept exactly — hemisphere, a key at (3,5,4)
 * and a cool rim behind — because it reads well on filament colours from
 * near-black to bone white. The grid and the ground are the ones that moved
 * to the new palette: the print bed should look like the app it lives in.
