The four bundled faces this app renders in, vendored as woff2. (Headings prefer
Arial Rounded, a system font whose licence doesn't allow bundling it; Nunito is
the fallback for devices that don't have it — see globals.css.)

They used to come from `next/font/google`, which downloads them at build time.
That made every image build — CI's `verify` gate, `release-images.yml`, and the
README's own build-from-source quick start — depend on fonts.googleapis.com
being reachable and willing. It failed exactly that way once, and the error
surfaces as a webpack stack trace about a font loader, which is not where anyone
looks first.

It was also inconsistent: Swagger UI is vendored out of node_modules precisely
because "a CDN would be unreachable on a NAS with no outbound internet", and the
app's own typefaces did not get the same treatment.

Nothing here is fetched at build or at runtime. `src/app/layout.tsx` loads these
files through `next/font/local`, which is why the CSP can keep font-src at
'self'.

  pacifico-400.woff2          the script logotype
  nunito-800.woff2            headings where Arial Rounded isn't installed
  archivo-100-900.woff2       body text — one variable file covers 400/500/600/700
  rubik-400-700.woff2         labels: refs, filenames, dimensions — one variable file

Latin subset only, which is what the app asked Google for before. To refresh
them, take the woff2 the Google Fonts CSS API serves for the latin block of each
family — but check whether the design still wants that face first, because a
silent typeface change is worse than a stale one.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
