/**
 * Open a request from a file on a model site, instead of an upload.
 *
 * The body is the wish an upload carries, plus `url` (the model's page) and
 * `fileId` (one of the files `POST /api/import/files` listed for it). The
 * server fetches that file itself and from there it is an upload in every
 * respect: `src/lib/intake.ts` inspects the bytes, stores them and opens the
 * ticket, and does not care what the site said the file was.
 *
 * The wish is checked before anything is fetched — a colour that is off the
 * shelf should not cost a 200 MB download to find out — and the fetch takes one
 * of the same slots an upload does, because it holds the same memory.
 *
 * The address fetched is never the caller's choice; `src/lib/import.ts` sets
 * out how.
