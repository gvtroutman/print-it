/**
 * The OpenAPI document, for the console at `/docs` and for anything else that
 * wants to read the surface — a client generator, a Postman import, `jq`.
 *
 * Behind a session, like everything else here except the healthcheck. The
 * reasoning is the same as it is for the rest of the app: this describes an
 * invite-only tool for one office, and an unauthenticated endpoint is not the
 * place to enumerate what it can do or how its authorisation is shaped. The
 * people who need it are already inside.
 *
 * And only the owner, like the console: a member is answered 403. The
 * endpoints it describes still work for members; the map of them does not.
 *
 * `/api/openapi.json` rather than `/openapi.json` so it inherits the one rule
 * that makes an API usable: middleware never redirects `/api/*`, so a caller
 * with no session is told 401 instead of being handed a sign-in page that a
 * JSON parser would choke on.
