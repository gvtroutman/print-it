 * can watch a real XHR upload progress bar against this, and a large model
 * over office wifi is long enough that a spinner is not good enough.
 *
 * This handler is the multipart door and nothing more: it takes the body
 * apart and hands a name and some bytes to `src/lib/intake.ts`, which decides
 * whether they become a ticket. Importing from a link is the other door onto
 * the same code.
