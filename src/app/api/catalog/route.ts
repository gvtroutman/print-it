/**
 * What can be asked for right now: the materials on the shelf, each with the
 * colours it comes in, in the owner's order.
 *
 * It exists because the choices stopped being a fixed list. While they were,
 * the OpenAPI document could enumerate them; once the owner manages them, a
 * client of `POST /api/upload` has no way to learn a valid pair except by
 * reading the upload page's HTML. This is the same read that page makes.
 *
 * Any signed-in person may read it — it is what the request form shows them.
 * Retired entries are left out rather than flagged, exactly as on the form,
 * and nothing here says how to manage the catalogue: that is `/admin/catalog`
 * and it has no JSON door.
