/**
 * Print an old ticket again — with the wish open for changes first.
 *
 * "Print again" used to be one click that cloned the ticket exactly. But the
 * second go is rarely the first one repeated: the test print was too weak, or
 * the wrong colour, or one was not enough. Cloning meant filing a request the
 * requester already knew was wrong and then explaining the difference in a
 * comment. So it lands here instead: the request form, without the dropzone,
 * filled in with what was asked for last time.
 *
 * Yours only. The read is scoped, so someone else's ticket is a 404, and so is
 * the owner's view of a ticket they did not ask for — being able to see a
 * request is not being the person whose request it is to repeat. The endpoint
 * the form posts to checks all of this again.
